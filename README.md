### ðŸŒŸ Analysis and Introduction

As an aspiring Data Analyst, I have an active presence on GitHub, with a willingness to engage and contribute to various projects. With a total of 16 commits, my commitment to development activities is evident.

Throughout my GitHub profile, I frequently work with SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel, showcasing a diverse skill set in data analysis and visualization. While the specific distribution of my commits is unavailable, the regularity of updates and maintenance in my repositories suggests consistency in my coding habits.

I have created two public repositories so far, including "DataWithAayush" and "netflix_sql_project." While the former serves as my portfolio, highlighting my diverse work, the latter reflects my interest in analyzing Netflix data using SQL.

Although I have limited external contributions, my dedication to personal projects demonstrates my commitment to enhancing my skills. I aspire to engage with the GitHub community further, contribute to external repositories, and receive pull requests, expanding my network and exposure.

With 2 public repositories, 1 follower, and 1 star across all my repositories, my presence on GitHub is currently minor. However, I am actively seeking growth opportunities and projects in the data analysis domain.
